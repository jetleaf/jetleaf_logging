/// {@template logRecord}
/// A `LogRecord` represents a single logging event captured by the logging system.
///
/// It holds metadata such as the log level, message, timestamp, error object,
/// and stack trace. This structure allows loggers to format and route logs
/// consistently and meaningfully.
///
/// This is particularly useful in diagnostic tools, analytics, and
/// structured log processing.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final record = LogRecord(
///   LogLevel.warning,
///   'Something suspicious happened',
///   loggerName: 'AuthService',
///   error: InvalidFormatException('Invalid token'),
///   stackTrace: StackTrace.current,
/// );
/// print(record);
/// ```
/// {@endtemplate}
final class LogRecord {
  /// The severity level of the log message.
  ///
  /// This determines how important the log message is, and can influence
  /// which messages are displayed or stored depending on the configured
  /// log level filters.
  ///
  /// Common levels include:
  /// - `LogLevel.debug`
  /// - `LogLevel.info`
  /// - `LogLevel.warning`
  /// - `LogLevel.error`
  /// - `LogLevel.fatal`

  /// yet descriptive.
  final String message;

  /// An optional name for the logger that produced this record.
  ///
  /// This helps identify the origin of the log in larger applications.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// loggerName: 'UserService'
  /// ```
  final String? loggerName;

  /// The timestamp indicating when this log record was created.
  ///
  /// If not explicitly passed, defaults to the current time via `DateTime.now()`.
  final DateTime time;

  /// Optional object representing the error or exception that occurred.
  ///
  /// This is useful for capturing caught errors along with the log message.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// error: InvalidArgumentException('User ID cannot be null')
  /// ```

  /// Optional stack trace associated with the error.
  ///
  /// Provides detailed context of where the error occurred, aiding in
  /// debugging and tracing the source of problems.
